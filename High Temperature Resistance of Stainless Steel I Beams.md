At SD-Steel, we take pride in offering top-tier stainless steel products that cater to a wide range of industrial and construction needs. Among our premium offerings are **stainless steel I beams**, renowned for their exceptional high-temperature resistance, durability, and versatility. Whether you're constructing industrial facilities, power plants, or high-temperature environments, our stainless steel I beams are engineered to meet the most demanding requirements.

## Product Overview

Stainless steel I beams are structural members with an "I" shaped cross-section that combine strength and stability. Our product line is designed to withstand extreme temperatures while maintaining its integrity and performance. This makes them ideal for applications where traditional materials may fail under thermal stress.

Our stainless steel I beams are crafted from high-grade alloys, ensuring superior corrosion resistance, excellent mechanical properties, and unparalleled longevity. The unique composition of these beams provides outstanding heat tolerance, making them suitable for use in furnaces, kilns, boilers, and other high-temperature environments.

## Material Specifications

The high temperature resistance of our stainless steel I beams is derived from their material composition. These beams are manufactured using austenitic stainless steel grades such as **304L** and **316L**, which offer excellent oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures. Additionally, we also provide **duplex stainless steel** options like **2205** for enhanced strength and corrosion resistance.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the material specifications:

| Grade         | Alloy Composition (%) | Yield Strength (MPa) | Tensile Strength (MPa) | Max Operating Temperature (°C) |
|---------------|-----------------------|----------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| 304L          | Cr 18, Ni 8, Mn 2     | ≥ 205               | ≥ 515                 | 870                           |
| 316L          | Cr 16, Ni 10, Mo 2    | ≥ 205               | ≥ 515                 | 870                           |
| 2205 Duplex   | Cr 22, Ni 5, Mo 3    | ≥ 410               | ≥ 690                 | 315                           |
