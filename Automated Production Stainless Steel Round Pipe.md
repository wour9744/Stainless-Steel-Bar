## Material Composition

Our Stainless Steel Round Pipes are made from high-grade austenitic stainless steel, primarily Grade 304 and Grade 316. Both grades offer excellent corrosion resistance, making them suitable for harsh environments such as coastal areas, chemical plants, and food processing facilities. 

| Grade | Composition (Approximate) | Key Features |
|-------|---------------------------|--------------|
| 304   | 18% Chromium, 8% Nickel    | Excellent corrosion resistance, widely used in general-purpose applications. |
| 316   | 16% Chromium, 10% Nickel, 2% Molybdenum | Superior corrosion resistance, particularly against chloride attack; ideal for marine environments. |

These materials ensure that our round pipes maintain their integrity over time, even when exposed to corrosive substances or extreme conditions.
