## Material and Composition

The Wire Processing Stainless Steel Soft Wire is composed of 304L grade stainless steel, which is renowned for its excellent corrosion resistance and toughness. This material composition ensures that the wire can withstand harsh environments and resist wear over time. Additionally, the low carbon content in 304L grade steel reduces the risk of intergranular corrosion, making it suitable for applications involving exposure to moisture or chemicals.
