## Material Properties

### Grade: 304 Stainless Steel  
The 304 grade is one of the most widely used stainless steel alloys due to its excellent resistance to oxidation and corrosion. It contains chromium (18-20%) and nickel (8-10.5%), which provide exceptional stability even in harsh conditions.

### Surface Treatment Options  
To further enhance its performance, we offer several surface treatments:
- **Electropolishing**: Provides a smooth, mirror-like finish while removing impurities.
- **Brushed Finish**: Adds texture and reduces fingerprints, making it ideal for visible areas.
- **Coated Finish**: A protective layer applied to improve wear resistance and UV protection.
- **PVD Coating**: Physical Vapor Deposition enhances durability and provides a range of color options.

Each surface treatment option is carefully selected based on the intended use case to ensure optimal results.
