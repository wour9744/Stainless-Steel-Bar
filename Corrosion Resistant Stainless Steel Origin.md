# Corrosion Resistant Stainless Steel Origin - SD-Steel

At **SD-Steel**, we take pride in offering high-quality corrosion-resistant stainless steel products that are designed to withstand the harshest environments while maintaining their aesthetic appeal and structural integrity. Our corrosion-resistant stainless steel is renowned for its exceptional durability and versatility, making it an ideal choice for various industrial and commercial applications.

## Product Description

Corrosion-resistant stainless steel is a type of steel alloy that contains chromium, which forms a passive layer on the surface of the metal, protecting it from rust and corrosion. This makes it particularly suitable for environments where exposure to moisture, chemicals, or extreme weather conditions is common. Our product line includes a variety of grades such as 304, 316, and 430, each tailored to specific needs and environments.

Our corrosion-resistant stainless steel is not only durable but also easy to maintain, making it a cost-effective solution for long-term projects. Whether you need materials for construction, manufacturing, or any other industry, our products ensure reliability and performance.

## Material Composition

| Grade | Chromium (%) | Nickel (%) | Carbon (%) | Other Elements |
|-------|--------------|------------|------------|----------------|
| 304   | 18-20        | 8-10.5     | ≤0.08      | Manganese, Silicon |
| 316   | 16-18        | 10-14      | ≤0.08      | Molybdenum, Manganese |
| 430   | 16-18        | -           | ≤0.15      | Titanium, Manganese |

Each grade offers unique properties that cater to different requirements. For instance, Grade 316 is particularly resistant to saltwater corrosion, making it perfect for marine applications.
