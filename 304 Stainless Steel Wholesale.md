## Product Description

### What is 304 Stainless Steel?

304 Stainless Steel is one of the most versatile and widely used types of stainless steel available today. It is an austenitic stainless steel, meaning it contains chromium and nickel as its primary alloying elements. This composition gives it excellent corrosion resistance, formability, and weldability, making it suitable for a wide array of applications.

### Key Features

- **Corrosion Resistance**: 304 Stainless Steel resists rust and corrosion, making it ideal for outdoor and marine applications.
- **Formability**: It can be easily formed into various shapes and sizes, from sheets to complex components.
- **Weldability**: It is easy to weld, making it a popular choice for fabrication projects.
- **Versatility**: Suitable for a wide range of industries including food processing, chemical, architectural, and more.
