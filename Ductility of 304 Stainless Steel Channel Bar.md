## Material Properties

### What is 304 Stainless Steel?

304 Stainless Steel is one of the most commonly used grades of stainless steel due to its excellent corrosion resistance and formability. It is composed of chromium (between 18% and 20%) and nickel (between 8% and 10.5%), with the remainder being iron and small amounts of carbon. This composition makes it highly resistant to oxidation and corrosion, even in harsh environments.

### Ductility of 304 Stainless Steel

Ductility refers to the ability of a material to deform under tensile stress without fracturing. The 304 Stainless Steel Channel Bar exhibits superior ductility, allowing it to be easily bent, shaped, and formed into various configurations. This property is crucial for applications that require precise shaping and forming, such as in structural components, frames, and supports.
