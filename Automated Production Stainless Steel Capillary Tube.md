## Material

Our stainless steel capillary tubes are made from high-grade stainless steel alloys, including but not limited to:

- **AISI 304**: Known for its excellent corrosion resistance and formability.
- **AISI 316**: Offers enhanced resistance to chlorides and acids compared to 304.
- **AISI 430**: Provides good oxidation resistance and is often used in high-temperature environments.

Each alloy is chosen based on the specific needs of the application, ensuring optimal performance under varying conditions.

| Alloy Type | Composition (%) | Applications |
|------------|-----------------|--------------|
| AISI 304   | Cr: 18-20, Ni: 8-10.5 | Medical instruments, food processing |
| AISI 316   | Cr: 16-18, Ni: 10-14, Mo: 2-3 | Chemical plants, marine equipment |
| AISI 430   | Cr: 16-18, Ti: 0.5-1.0 | Heat exchangers, furnace parts |
