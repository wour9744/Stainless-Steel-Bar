## Material Composition

Our stainless steel products are made from premium-grade materials that ensure durability and reliability. The primary alloying elements include chromium, nickel, and molybdenum, which contribute to their superior corrosion resistance. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the key components:

| Element       | Function                                                                 |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chromium (Cr) | Provides corrosion resistance by forming a passive layer on the surface   |
| Nickel (Ni)   | Enhances toughness and ductility, especially at lower temperatures        |
| Molybdenum (Mo)| Increases pitting resistance and strengthens the material                 |

These elements work together to create a robust material that can withstand harsh environments while maintaining its structural integrity.
