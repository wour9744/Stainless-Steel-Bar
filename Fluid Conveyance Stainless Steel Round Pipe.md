## Product Description

Our Fluid Conveyance Stainless Steel Round Pipes are crafted from premium-grade materials, ensuring exceptional strength and corrosion resistance. These pipes are ideal for transporting fluids such as water, gases, oils, and chemicals, making them indispensable in industrial settings where reliability is paramount. The smooth interior surface of these pipes minimizes friction losses and ensures efficient flow, while their robust exterior provides long-lasting protection against external elements.

## Material Composition

The stainless steel used in our round pipes is sourced from reputable suppliers and undergoes rigorous quality checks to ensure it meets international standards. The material composition typically includes:

- **Chromium (Cr):** Enhances corrosion resistance.
- **Nickel (Ni):** Improves toughness and ductility.
- **Molybdenum (Mo):** Provides additional corrosion resistance, especially in chloride environments.
- **Carbon (C):** Ensures structural integrity and strength.

We offer various grades of stainless steel, including 304, 316, and 316L, each tailored to specific application requirements. For instance, grade 316L is particularly suitable for applications involving aggressive chemicals due to its excellent pitting resistance.

| Grade | Chromium Content | Nickel Content | Applications |
|-------|------------------|----------------|--------------|
| 304   | 18-20%           | 8-10.5%        | General-purpose use |
| 316   | 16-18%           | 10-14%         | Chemical processing |
| 316L  | 16-18%           | 10-14%         | High-corrosion environments |
