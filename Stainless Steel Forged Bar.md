## Material Composition and Properties

The exceptional performance of our Stainless Steel Forged Bars stems from their precise composition and manufacturing process. Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

| Grade | Chromium (%) | Nickel (%) | Carbon (%) | Applications |
|-------|--------------|------------|------------|--------------|
| 304    | 18-20        | 8-10.5     | ≤0.08      | General Purpose |
| 316    | 16-18        | 10-14      | ≤0.08      | Marine Environments |
| 316L   | 16-18        | 10-14      | ≤0.03      | Corrosive Environments |
| 430    | 16-18        | -           | ≤0.15      | Lower Cost Option |

These grades offer varying levels of corrosion resistance, temperature tolerance, and mechanical strength, making them suitable for diverse environments. The low carbon content in some grades ensures excellent weldability, while the chromium content provides outstanding resistance to oxidation and rusting.
