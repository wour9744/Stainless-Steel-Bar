## Material Composition

The 304 Stainless Steel Flat Bar is composed primarily of chromium (18-20%) and nickel (8-10.5%), which contribute to its excellent corrosion resistance and durability. Additionally, it contains small amounts of carbon, manganese, silicon, phosphorus, and sulfur. These elements enhance its mechanical strength while maintaining its formability and weldability.

This grade of stainless steel is non-magnetic in its cold-worked state and offers excellent resistance to atmospheric corrosion, making it suitable for indoor and outdoor applications alike. Its ability to withstand harsh environments without losing its integrity makes it a top choice for demanding projects.
