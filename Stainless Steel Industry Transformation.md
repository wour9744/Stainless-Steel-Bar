## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**Q1: What is the difference between AISI 304 and AISI 316L?**

**A1:** AISI 304 is commonly used for general-purpose applications due to its excellent corrosion resistance and formability. On the other hand, AISI 316L offers superior corrosion resistance, especially in chloride environments, making it ideal for more demanding applications.

**Q2: How do I determine the right size for my project?**

**A2:** To determine the appropriate size, consider the specific requirements of your project, such as load-bearing capacity, environmental conditions, and aesthetic considerations. Our technical support team can help guide you through the selection process.

**Q3: Do you offer custom orders?**

**A3:** Yes, we do offer custom orders to meet unique project specifications. Please contact us with your requirements, and our team will provide a tailored solution.
