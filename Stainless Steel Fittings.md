## Material Specifications

The heart of our stainless steel fittings lies in their material composition. We primarily use AISI 304 and AISI 316 stainless steel, known for their excellent resistance to corrosion and high temperatures. Below is a table summarizing the key properties of these materials:

| Material | Alloy Composition (%) | Corrosion Resistance | Temperature Range (°C) |
|----------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| AISI 304 | Cr: 18, Ni: 8, Fe: Bal | High                  | -196°C to 870°C        |
| AISI 316 | Cr: 16, Ni: 10, Mo: 2 | Very High             | -196°C to 870°C        |

These materials make our fittings ideal for applications involving exposure to water, chemicals, and extreme conditions.
