## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**Q1: What makes stainless steel round pipes corrosion-resistant?**

A1: Stainless steel contains chromium, which forms a passive layer of chromium oxide on the surface of the pipe. This layer protects the underlying metal from corrosion, even in harsh environments.

**Q2: Can these pipes be used in outdoor applications?**

A2: Absolutely! Our stainless steel round pipes are designed to withstand exposure to the elements, making them suitable for both indoor and outdoor use.

**Q3: Do you offer custom sizes?**

A3: Yes, we do offer custom sizes to meet your specific needs. Please contact us with your requirements, and we will work with you to create a solution tailored to your project.

**Q4: How do I maintain the pipes?**

A4: Regular cleaning with mild soap and water is usually sufficient. Avoid using abrasive cleaners that could damage the surface.

**Q5: What certifications do your products hold?**

A5: Our stainless steel round pipes are certified by ISO 9001 and meet international standards such as ASTM A269 and ASME B36.19M.
