## FAQs

### Q: What is the difference between SS304 and SS316?

**A:** SS304 is the most common grade of stainless steel, known for its excellent corrosion resistance and formability. SS316 offers enhanced resistance to pitting and crevice corrosion due to the addition of molybdenum, making it suitable for more aggressive environments.

### Q: Can you provide custom sizes?

**A:** Absolutely! We offer customization services to meet your specific project requirements. Please provide us with your dimensions, and our team will tailor the product accordingly.

### Q: How do I maintain my stainless steel shaped bars?

**A:** Regular cleaning with mild detergent and water is sufficient. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or tools that may scratch the surface. For tougher stains, use a non-abrasive cleaner followed by a thorough rinse.
