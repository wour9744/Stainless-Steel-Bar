## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**Q: What is the difference between 304 and 316 Stainless Steel?**
A: Both 304 and 316 grades offer excellent corrosion resistance, but 316 contains molybdenum, which provides even greater resistance to chloride corrosion. For most general applications, 304 is sufficient and more cost-effective.

**Q: Can I get custom sizes for the angle bars?**
A: Absolutely! We offer custom sizes based on your specific requirements. Please contact us at +65 83016969 for custom orders.

**Q: How do I maintain the angle bars to ensure longevity?**
A: Regular cleaning with mild soap and water is usually sufficient. Avoid abrasive cleaners or tools that may scratch the surface. For tougher stains, use a non-abrasive cleaner followed by a thorough rinse.
