Let’s explore the details of this remarkable material and how it can benefit your projects.

## What is Stainless Steel?

Stainless steel is an alloy primarily composed of iron, chromium, and other elements like nickel and carbon. The chromium content creates a passive layer on the surface of the steel, preventing rust and corrosion. This unique property makes stainless steel ideal for environments where durability and hygiene are paramount.

At SD-Steel, we pride ourselves on offering a diverse range of stainless steel grades, each tailored to specific needs. From austenitic grades (e.g., 304, 316) to martensitic and ferritic grades, our products deliver exceptional performance across various industries.
