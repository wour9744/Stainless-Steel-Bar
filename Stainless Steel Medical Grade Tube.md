# Stainless Steel Medical Grade Tube - Precision and Durability for Healthcare Applications

At SD-steel, we take pride in offering high-quality stainless steel medical grade tubes that cater to the demanding needs of the healthcare industry. Our products are designed with precision engineering and strict adherence to international standards, ensuring they meet the highest quality benchmarks. Whether you're developing advanced medical equipment or constructing hospital infrastructure, our stainless steel medical grade tubes provide the durability, reliability, and performance necessary for critical applications.

## Product Description

Our Stainless Steel Medical Grade Tubes are crafted from premium-grade stainless steel, specifically formulated to withstand rigorous sterilization processes, corrosion, and wear. These tubes are commonly used in surgical instruments, endoscopic devices, catheters, and other medical equipment where hygiene and longevity are paramount. The smooth surface finish of these tubes minimizes bacterial adhesion, making them ideal for environments where cleanliness is non-negotiable.

The tubes come in a variety of diameters, wall thicknesses, and lengths, allowing for customization based on specific requirements. Each tube undergoes rigorous testing to ensure it meets ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) and ISO (International Organization for Standardization) standards. We also offer specialized coatings and finishes upon request to enhance their performance in unique medical settings.

## Material Composition

| Material | Grade | Alloy Content (%) |
|----------|-------|------------------|
| Stainless Steel | 316L | 17-18% Chromium, 10-14% Nickel, 2-3% Molybdenum |
| Stainless Steel | 304L | 18% Chromium, 8% Nickel |

The primary grades of stainless steel used in our medical grade tubes are 316L and 304L. Both grades are renowned for their excellent corrosion resistance, formability, and biocompatibility. The inclusion of molybdenum in grade 316L enhances its ability to resist pitting and crevice corrosion, making it ideal for environments exposed to harsh chemicals and saline solutions.
