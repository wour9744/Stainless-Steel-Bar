## Material and Specifications

| **Grade**        | **Diameter (mm)** | **Length (m)** | **Coating Type** |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------------|------------------|
| AISI 304         | 10 - 50           | 3 - 6          | Epoxy            |
| AISI 316         | 20 - 100          | 3 - 12         | Polyurethane     |
| AISI 430         | 15 - 80           | 4 - 8          | Zinc Chromate    |

Each grade offers unique properties tailored to specific applications. For instance, AISI 304 is widely used in general-purpose applications due to its excellent corrosion resistance, while AISI 316 is ideal for more demanding environments where higher resistance to chlorides is required. AISI 430 provides good oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures and is commonly used in heat exchangers and other thermal equipment.
