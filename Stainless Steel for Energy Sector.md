### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

**Q1: What is the difference between austenitic and martensitic stainless steel?**

**A1:** Austenitic stainless steels like 304 and 316 have excellent corrosion resistance and formability but are not as strong as martensitic grades. Martensitic stainless steels like 410 are harder and stronger, making them suitable for wear-resistant applications.

**Q2: Can you provide custom sizes for your stainless steel products?**

**A2:** Absolutely! We offer custom sizes for most of our products to meet specific project requirements. Please contact us with your specifications for a tailored solution.

**Q3: How do I ensure proper maintenance of stainless steel products in harsh environments?**

**A3:** Regular cleaning with mild detergent and water is usually sufficient. For tougher environments, consider using specialized cleaning agents and protective coatings. Avoid contact with chloride-rich substances which can cause pitting.
