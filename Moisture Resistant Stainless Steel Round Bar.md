## Material Composition

Our Moisture Resistant Stainless Steel Round Bar is manufactured using advanced alloying techniques, primarily incorporating chromium, nickel, and molybdenum. These elements contribute to the bar's excellent corrosion resistance, making it suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. The chromium content forms a passive layer on the surface, protecting the material from rust and oxidation, while nickel enhances toughness and ductility.

The exact composition may vary slightly depending on the grade of stainless steel used. Below is a table showcasing some common grades and their specifications:

| Grade         | Chromium (%) | Nickel (%) | Molybdenum (%) | Tensile Strength (MPa) |
|---------------|--------------|------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| SS304         | 18-20        | 8-10.5     | 0              | ≥515                    |
| SS316         | 16-18        | 10-14      | 2-3            | ≥570                    |
| SS316L        | 16-18        | 10-14      | 2-3            | ≥480                    |
